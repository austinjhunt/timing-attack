hi austin if you dont mind me asking how many questions were on the quiz, i am also worried about the 1 hr time limit it is quite sparse

i cant recall if he said in the first class if he curves?
im pretty sure he doesnt, i mean i am not worried about any grades in this course other than the midterm and finals, i figured it would be a lot
Me to Lexie Webel (Direct Message) 07:44 PM
i think he mentioned in the very first class that he was against curving but i don't remember clearly
